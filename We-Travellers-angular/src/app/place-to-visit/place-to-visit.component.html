      <p class="lead">The Panch Pokhari (Five Ponds) Path is a new trekking area in Nepal. Panch Pokhari (4,100 m) is located northeast of Kathmandu at the base of the Jugal Himal. The period from March to May is the best time for trek to Panch Pokhari. This place has cultural, religious, and ecological importance. An important festival, the Janai Purnima festival, is held here every year in August, when Brahmin castes come here for the ritual changing of the sacred thread (janai) they wear around their bodies. Thus, the five ponds (Panch Pokhari) are regarded as sacred ponds. Situated as they are at the base of the Jugal Himal, the ecology is pretty diverse and of considerable interest. The trek takes you through Sherpa and Tamang villages, so it’s something of a Nepal cultural trek, as well.Generally, it’s a 10-day trek, the starting point being Chautara (1,200 m) to the northeast of, and about a five-hour drive by bus from, Kathmandu. To make it clearer, you’ll be going towards the Tibetan border.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Mount Kanjiroba Himal lies in western part of Nepal at Dolpa region. It has been past more than twenty five years, since we were captivated by a remarkable high mountain range, 40km far away to the north, seen from the top of Tso Karpo Kang (6556m) in the north-eastern corner of Kanjiroba Himal in 1971. Name of these mountains was quite unknown at that time, we had only a vague idea that must be on the Nepal=Tibet border and in the easternmost part of Mugu district. On old maps by Survey of India, from 1930's, afterward, the name Kubi Kangri was roughly given to these mountain ranges, probably from the data of Sven Hedin's expedition in 1907. How to access to these mountains has long been the center of our interest thereafter. Our flight starts from Nepalgunja to Juphal then trek up to Jopala Khola and Kanjiroba Base camp, our route will be back with same trail and flight to Nepalgunja from Juphal and take flight to Kathmandu.</p>
